# overview of the project #

# Objectives:
   * Basic Functionality: Implement basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   * User-Friendly Interface: Design an intuitive and responsive user interface that is easy to use.
   * Error Handling: Ensure the calculator handles errors gracefully (e.g., division by zero, invalid input).
   * Aesthetic Design: Apply CSS to make the calculator visually appealing.

 # Key Activities: #

1. Planning and Design: 

 * Define the structure and layout of the calculator.
 * Create wireframes or mockups of the UI.
2. HTML Structure:

 * Develop the HTML structure for the calculator, including buttons for digits, operators, and a display screen.

3. JavaScript Functionality:

 * Basic Operations: Implement basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
 * Advanced Features: Optionally, include advanced features such as percentage, square root, memory functions, etc.

4. Testing and Debugging:

 * Cross-Browser Compatibility: Test the calculator across different web browsers to ensure consistent behavior.
 * Edge Cases: Test for edge cases and unusual input scenarios to make the calculator robust.

    
# Technologies Used:

1. HTML:

 * Structure the layout of the calculator.
 * Use elements like <div>, <button>, and <input> to create the interface.
   
2. CSS:

 * Style the calculator's appearance.
 * Use CSS Flexbox or Grid for layout.
 * Implement media queries for responsiveness.
   
3. JavaScript:

 * Handle the logic for calculations.
 * Manage user interactions and update the display.
 * Use event listeners to capture button clicks.
